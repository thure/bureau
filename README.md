bureau.js
========

Bureau is a little library that helps you make forms that respond to user input. It's meant to help you perform typical tasks associated with designing complex HTML forms, such as showing/hiding additional form elements depending on the values of other form elements.

Currently this is a stub of its future form, with many more features currently in development. The merge from my local repository with this one on Github has not yet occurred.

Additional planned features are:
+ ease of setting up
+ masking inputs
+ input validation (built-in, and compatibility with M*C frameworks)
+ animation
+ model-binding compatibility
+ optional jquery-ui integration
+ thorough mobile compatibility
